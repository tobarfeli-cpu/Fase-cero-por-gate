# OOE – Standard Prompt Methodology (Gate-Based Execution)

**Document ID:** OOE-PROMPT-METHODOLOGY  
**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Owner:** One O Eight Consulting (OOE)  
**Applies To:** All OOE AI Prompts (Phase 0 and beyond)

---

## 1. Core Methodological Principles

All prompts executed under the OOE framework must follow a methodology that is:

- Strictly sequential
- Gate-based
- Evidence-driven
- Fully traceable, auditable, and repeatable

Speed shall never take precedence over regulatory accuracy, evidence validation, or risk transparency.

---

## 2. Prompt Development by Stages

### 2.1 Stage-Based Structure

Each prompt **must be developed and executed by STAGES**.

- Each Stage corresponds to one or more Gates
- Stages are logical, bounded, and explicitly defined
- Stages **cannot be merged, skipped, or resolved implicitly**

---

### 2.2 Mandatory Sequential Execution

Stages and Gates **must be executed strictly in order**.

- Advancement is prohibited without:
  - Full evaluation, or
  - Explicit user authorization
- Sequential execution ensures:
  - QA integrity
  - Risk containment
  - Full auditability

---

## 3. Controlled Pauses for Information Requests

### 3.1 Mandatory Stop Conditions

The model **must pause execution** whenever:

- Required evidence is missing
- Evidence is not independently verifiable
- Regulatory conflicts cannot be resolved

---

### 3.2 Evidence Request Rules (Mandatory)

Whenever the model pauses to request information, it **must explicitly specify**:

1. The affected Gate and item
2. The exact evidence required
3. Evidence requirements **must always include**:
   - A live link (functional URL)
   - Full web address (www…)
   - Bookmark or reproducible navigation path within the official source

Generic or ambiguous requests are not permitted.

---

## 4. Item-Level Evaluation

Each Gate contains predefined checklist items.

- Every item must be evaluated individually
- No item may be omitted
- No inference or implicit resolution is allowed

---

## 5. Normative Requirement vs Evidence Logic

For each item, the model must:

1. Identify the applicable regulatory requirement
2. Identify available evidence
3. Directly compare requirement vs evidence
4. Assign status **only based on verifiable evidence**

---

## 6. Evidence Classification

Evidence is classified as:

- **Official / Independent Evidence**
- **User-Provided Evidence**

User-provided evidence **does not constitute independent verification**.

---

## 7. Standardized Item Statuses

Each item must have **one and only one** status:

- `CLOSED – VERIFIED`
- `CLOSED – USER-PROVIDED`
- `OPEN – NEED EVIDENCE`
- `HOLD – BLOCKING ISSUE`

---

## 8. Assumption Control

- Assumptions are not permitted
- If unavoidable, they must be:
  - Explicitly disclosed
  - Logged as `CONDITIONAL – ASSUMPTION DISCLOSED`
- Assumptions **never justify a CLOSED status**

---

## 9. Conflict Identification

Any conflict between regulations, sources, or interpretations must be:

- Explicitly documented
- Maintained as `OPEN` or `HOLD` depending on severity

---

## 10. Conditional Advancement Authorized by User

The user may authorize advancement to the next Gate.

- The Gate is marked as `CONDITIONAL – USER AUTHORIZED`
- All item statuses remain unchanged
- Associated risks must be documented

---

## 11. Mandatory Final Evidence Reporting

### 11.1 Universal Evidence Reporting Rule

At the end of execution, **all items must report evidence**, regardless of status.

This includes items marked as:
- CLOSED
- OPEN
- HOLD

---

### 11.2 Evidence Requirements per Item

Each item must independently list:

- Live link
- Full web address (www…)
- Bookmark or reproducible navigation path

Cross-referencing evidence implicitly is not allowed.

---

## 12. Final Chat Delivery Structure (Mandatory)

The final delivery in the chat **must be organized by status**, using at minimum the following sections:

### 12.1 CLOSED – VERIFIED
- Item list
- Full independent evidence per item

### 12.2 CLOSED – USER-PROVIDED
- Item list
- User-provided evidence clearly identified

### 12.3 OPEN – NEED EVIDENCE
- Item list
- Explicit evidence request per item
- Suggested official sources where applicable

### 12.4 HOLD – BLOCKING ISSUE
- Item list
- Description of blocking condition
- Associated evidence

---

## 13. Methodological Priority Rule

The process must remain fully repeatable and auditable.

When a conflict arises between:
- Speed, and
- Regulatory accuracy

**Regulatory accuracy and risk transparency always prevail.**
